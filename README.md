Running Guessing Game
=====================

Asks the user to guess how many miles are in a half-marathon (the correct
answer is 13.1). If the user guesses correctly, a congratulatory message is
sent to the output. If the user guesses incorrectly, a message is displayed
telling them whether the guess was j=high or low an dasking for a new value.

The code was refactored adding a loop to keep the game going and giving teh hint
to whether the guess was high or low as a pair programming exercise. We used
Google to check for JavaScript functions.
